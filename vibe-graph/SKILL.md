  Dual-layer dependency graph for vibe-* projects. No external packages.
  DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.json maps file-level relationships with confidence
  tagging: EXTRACTED (verified from source, confidence 1.0), INFERRED
  (derived from specs/patterns, 0.6–0.95), AMBIGUOUS (flagged for review).
  Rationale nodes capture WHY, HACK, DECISION comments from source files —
  surfaced during bug diagnosis and review to prevent intent drift.
  God nodes identify highest-coupling files — read first in review,
  flagged in bug diagnosis, blocked from simultaneous parallel writes.
  CONCEPT_GRAPH.json maps semantic relationships (features, agents,
  models, components). graph.html is an interactive visual.
  Auto-updated via git diff. Queried by vibe-fix-bug, vibe-test,
  vibe-review, vibe-parallel. Saves 65-70% context tokens.
  Triggers on "vibe-graph: build", "vibe-graph: update", "vibe-graph: init",
  "vibe-graph: rebuild", "vibe-graph: query", "vibe-graph: status".

# Vibe Graph Skill

Dual-layer dependency graph for vibe-* projects.
Starts as a spec graph before code exists.
Grows into a full dependency map as the project is built.
Updated automatically from git diff — no agent self-reporting.

Three concepts from graphify integrated throughout:
1. **Relationship confidence tagging** — EXTRACTED / INFERRED / AMBIGUOUS on every edge
2. **Rationale nodes** — WHY, HACK, DECISION comments extracted from source files
3. **God nodes** — highest-degree files surfaced for priority review and safe parallel dispatch

---

## The two layers

### Layer 1 — DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.json (file-level)
Maps technical relationships between files.
What imports what. What's tested by what. What route calls what handler.
Every edge tagged EXTRACTED / INFERRED / AMBIGUOUS with confidence score.
Rationale nodes stored per file — why the file works the way it does.
Used by: bug diagnosis, blast radius tracing, test generation, parallel safety.

### Layer 2 — CONCEPT_GRAPH.json (concept-level)
Maps semantic relationships between features, agents, models, components.
What concept owns what files. What concepts depend on each other.
Starts from SPEC.md and ARCHITECTURE.md before code exists.
Nodes transition from `planned` to `built` as features are implemented.
Used by: review boundary checking, impact assessment, progress tracking.

---

## Commands

```
vibe-graph: init      ← called by vibe-new-app after scaffold created
vibe-graph: build     ← called by vibe-init after CODEBASE.md written
vibe-graph: update    ← called by vibe-add-feature and vibe-fix-bug at session end
vibe-graph: rebuild   ← full rebuild from scratch (recovery command)
vibe-graph: query [file or concept]  ← manual query during debugging
vibe-graph: status    ← graph health, coverage, god nodes, ambiguous edges
```

---

## Node states

Every node in both graphs has one of three states:

```
planned  → exists in SPEC.md or ARCHITECTURE.md, no code yet
           all edges are INFERRED at this stage
partial  → some tasks complete, feature not fully implemented
built    → all tasks complete, file exists, EXTRACTED edges confirmed
deleted  → file was removed — state transitions, node never removed
```

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight

```bash
# Verify git is initialised
git status 2>/dev/null || { echo "Not a git repo — vibe-graph requires git"; exit 1; }

# Create graph directory
mkdir -p vibe/graph

# Check for existing graph
ls vibe/graph/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.json 2>/dev/null && echo "GRAPH EXISTS" || echo "NEW GRAPH"
```

---

## Command: vibe-graph init

**Called by:** `vibe-new-app` after scaffold is created.
**Purpose:** Build the spec graph from SPEC.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
before any code exists. All nodes are `planned` state.
All edges are INFERRED — code hasn't been written yet.

Read `references/SPEC_TO_GRAPH.md` before this step.

**Step 1 — Read planning documents:**
```bash
cat vibe/SPEC.md
cat vibe/ARCHITECTURE.md
cat vibe/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
cat AGENT_ARCH.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 2 — Extract planned concepts from SPEC.md:**

For each feature, agent, model, route, and component in SPEC.md:
Create a concept node with `state: planned`.
Apply confidence scores per SPEC_TO_GRAPH.md rules.
Explicit feature dependencies → `confidence: 0.95`.
Acceptance criteria references → `confidence: 0.90`.

**Step 3 — Extract planned file nodes from ARCHITECTURE.md:**

For each planned file in the folder structure section:
Create a file node with `state: planned`.
Assign concept with INFERRED tag and appropriate confidence.
Folder comment = 0.85. File naming = 0.85. Pattern inference = 0.85.

**Step 4 — For agentic projects, read AGENT_ARCH.md:**
Extract agent topology — which agents call which, tool assignments,
verifier relationships, HITL checkpoints.
All AGENT_ARCH.md edges: `source: INFERRED, confidence: 0.95`.

**Step 5 — Write initial graphs:**

Write `vibe/graph/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.json` — all planned file nodes.
Write `vibe/graph/CONCEPT_GRAPH.json` — all planned concept nodes.
Write `vibe/graph/.graph-meta.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "created": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "last_updated": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "update_count": 0,
  "mode": "spec",
  "nodes_planned": 0,
  "nodes_built": 0,
  "god_nodes": [],
  "ambiguous_count": 0,
  "project": "[project name]"
}
```

**Step 6 — Generate initial graph.html:**
Read `references/GRAPH_HTML_TEMPLATE.md` for visual format.
Planned nodes: lighter colour, dashed border.
INFERRED edges: dashed lines. EXTRACTED edges: solid lines.
No EXTRACTED edges yet — all relationships are INFERRED at init.

**Step 7 — Tell vibe-new-app:**
```
vibe-graph: init complete
  Planned concepts: [N]
  Planned files:    [N]
  INFERRED edges:   [N] (all edges — code not yet written)
  Graph location:   vibe/graph/
  State: SPEC GRAPH — edges transition to EXTRACTED as files are built
```

---

## Command: vibe-graph build

**Called by:** `vibe-init` after CODEBASE.md is written.
**Purpose:** One-time build for existing projects from CODEBASE.md.

Read `references/CODEBASE_TO_GRAPH.md` before this step.

**Step 1 — Read CODEBASE.md in full:**
```bash
cat vibe/CODEBASE.md
```

**Step 2 — Parse CODEBASE.md sections into nodes with confidence tags:**

Routes, models, components, agents — per CODEBASE_TO_GRAPH.md.
All relationships extracted from CODEBASE.md: `source: EXTRACTED, confidence: 1.0`.

**Step 3 — Attempt rationale extraction:**
For each file found in CODEBASE.md, if the source file is accessible:
```bash
cat [file_path] | grep -n "# WHY:\|# HACK:\|# NOTE:\|# IMPORTANT:\|# REASON:\|# DECISION:\|# TRADEOFF:\|# WARNING:\|# TODO:\|# FIXME:" 2>/dev/null
```
Extract rationale comments and first-paragraph docstrings.
Store in `rationale` array on the file node.
If file not accessible — leave `rationale: []`, populate on first update.

**Step 4 — Compute hashes for all files:**
```bash
git log -1 --format="%H %ai" -- [file_path]
git hash-object [file_path]
```

**Step 5 — Build concept assignments:**
Per CODEBASE_TO_GRAPH.md concept assignment rules.
Feature folder Touches field → EXTRACTED, 1.0.
Naming match → INFERRED, 0.85.
Fallback → foundation, INFERRED, 0.70.

**Step 6 — Compute god nodes:**
```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

graph = json.loads(Path('vibe/graph/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.json').read_text())

degree = {}
for file_path, node in graph.items():
    if not isinstance(node, dict):
        continue
    imports = node.get('imports', [])
    imported_by = node.get('imported_by', [])
    degree[file_path] = len(imports) + len(imported_by)

god_nodes = sorted(degree.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]

result = []
for file_path, connections in god_nodes:
    node = graph.get(file_path, {})
    entry = {
        'file': file_path,
        'connections': connections,
        'concept': node.get('concept', 'foundation'),
        'type': node.get('type', 'unknown'),
        'risk': 'HIGH' if connections > 10 else 'MEDIUM' if connections > 5 else 'LOW'
    }
    if connections > 10:
        entry['srp_flag'] = True
        entry['srp_note'] = f'{connections} connections — consider splitting for SRP'
    result.append(entry)

print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

Write god nodes to `.graph-meta.json`.

**Step 7 — Collect AMBIGUOUS edges:**
Run `collect_ambiguous()` per CODEBASE_TO_GRAPH.md.
Write count and list to `.graph-meta.json`.

**Step 8 — Write all output files.**

**Step 9 — Tell vibe-init:**
```
vibe-graph: build complete
  Files indexed:    [N]
  Concepts mapped:  [N]
  EXTRACTED edges:  [N]
  INFERRED edges:   [N]
  AMBIGUOUS edges:  [N] (see vibe-graph: status for details)
  Rationale nodes:  [N] (WHY/HACK/DECISION comments extracted)
  God nodes:        [top file] ([N] connections), [2nd], [3rd]
  State: BUILT — graph reflects current codebase
```

---

## Command: vibe-graph update

**Called by:** `vibe-add-feature` and `vibe-fix-bug` at session end.
**Purpose:** Incremental update — only files changed this session.

**Step 1 — Read git diff to find changed files:**
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
git diff --name-only --cached
```

**Step 2 — For each changed file:**

Check if it's a new file (not in graph) or an update to an existing node.

**Step 3 — Transition INFERRED → EXTRACTED:**

For each changed file, read it and extract actual imports:
```bash
# Python
grep -n "^import \|^from " [file_path]

# TypeScript/JS
grep -n "^import \|^require(" [file_path]

# Go
grep -n "^import" [file_path]
```

For each actual import found:
- If it matches an INFERRED edge → update to `EXTRACTED, confidence: 1.0`, add line number evidence
- If it's a new import not in the graph → add as new EXTRACTED edge
- If a planned INFERRED edge is NOT found in actual imports → mark as AMBIGUOUS, flag in status

**Step 4 — Extract rationale comments from changed files:**
```bash
grep -n "# WHY:\|# HACK:\|# NOTE:\|# IMPORTANT:\|# REASON:\|# DECISION:\|# TRADEOFF:\|# WARNING:" [file_path]
# Also extract first 5 lines of module docstring if present
```
Update `rationale` array on the node. Append new entries, never overwrite existing.

**Step 5 — Update concept node state:**

For each concept affected by changed files:
- If all planned files now have state=built → concept state=built
- Update `files` list, `tasks_complete` count
- Update concept edges: if corresponding file import was confirmed → edge source = EXTRACTED

**Step 6 — Recompute god nodes:**
God nodes change as files are added and connections grow.
Recompute after every update that adds 3+ new edges.

**Step 7 — Update graph.html:**
Re-render subgraph of changed nodes and their neighbours.
Transition planned→built (colour change). INFERRED→EXTRACTED (dashed→solid line).

**Step 8 — Update .graph-meta.json:**
```json
{
  "last_updated": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "update_count": "[N+1]",
  "files_updated_this_run": "[N]",
  "mode": "incremental",
  "god_nodes": "[recomputed list]",
  "ambiguous_count": "[updated count]",
  "inferred_to_extracted_this_run": "[N]"
}
```

**Step 9 — Report back:**
```
vibe-graph: update complete
  Files re-indexed:          [N] (from git diff)
  EXTRACTED edges confirmed: [N] (INFERRED → EXTRACTED transitions)
  New EXTRACTED edges:       [N]
  Rationale nodes added:     [N]
  AMBIGUOUS edges:           [N] (run vibe-graph: status to review)
  God nodes updated:         [top file] ([N] connections)
  Nodes built/total:         [N]/[N] ([%] complete)
```

```

---

## How vibe-fix-bug uses the graph

Read `references/GRAPH_QUERY_PATTERNS.md` for the full query protocol.

At diagnosis start, instead of loading CODEBASE.md:

```
1. Check if suspected file is a god node
   → If yes: warn about large blast radius upfront

2. Read rationale nodes for the suspected file
   → Know WHY the file works the way it does BEFORE proposing a fix
   → This prevents fixing a bug by breaking a documented design decision

3. Query blast radius with confidence tiers
   → CERTAIN (EXTRACTED): load immediately — these are definitely involved
   → PROBABLE (INFERRED ≥0.80): load if CERTAIN tier doesn't resolve
   → Skip AMBIGUOUS — flag separately

4. Query concept for upstream/downstream propagation
   → Check if bug could originate from or propagate to adjacent concepts
```

---

## How vibe-test uses the graph

At blast radius detection start:

```
1. Get changed files from git diff (already done by vibe-graph: update)
2. For each changed file: get EXTRACTED connections
   → Certain test scope (full regression)
3. For each changed file: get INFERRED ≥0.80 connections
   → Probable test scope (smoke tests)
4. Write tests tier by tier — certain first, probable second
5. Files marked ⚠️ no test — create test file
```

---

## How vibe-review uses the graph

At review start, before reading any source files:

```
1. Read god nodes from .graph-meta.json
   → These are read first — highest coupling = highest review priority
   → SRP flag on any god node > 10 connections = check for SRP violation

2. Run concept boundary pre-screening (EXTRACTED edges only)
   → Cross-concept imports = potential violations
   → AMBIGUOUS edges = surface separately, not as violations

3. Read rationale nodes for all files in scope
   → Any code that contradicts a WHY or DECISION rationale = P1 finding (intent drift)

4. Files with violations or SRP flags → deep read
5. Files with no violations, not god nodes → shallow review only
```

---

## How vibe-parallel uses the graph

Before dispatching subagents:

```
1. Check for direct file conflicts (Task A and Task B both write same file)
   → BLOCK: move one task to next wave

2. Check for god node conflicts (both tasks touch files connected to same god node)
   → WARN: ask before dispatching, consider sequencing

3. High-SRP-flag god nodes are never written by two waves simultaneously
   → Treat as implicit serialisation point
```

---

## Absolute rules

**Git diff is the only source of truth for what changed.**
Never rely on agent memory, task manifests, or Touches field alone.
`git diff --name-only HEAD` before every incremental update.

**Never fabricate confidence.**
If the evidence for an edge is weak — mark INFERRED with low confidence.
If unclear — mark AMBIGUOUS. Never upgrade AMBIGUOUS to EXTRACTED without source evidence.

**Never remove a node — only transition state.**
A deleted file transitions to `state: deleted`, not removed from the graph.
Deletion is a graph event — other files may still import it.

**Concept assignment is append-only.**
Once assigned, a file stays in its concept.
Multiple concepts → add `secondary_concepts` field.
Never reassign primary concept without logging in DECISIONS.md.

**Rationale nodes are append-only.**
New rationale comments are appended to the array.
Never overwrite or remove existing rationale entries.
If a rationale comment is deleted from source — log it as a deletion event,
don't remove it from the graph.

**AMBIGUOUS edges must be resolved, not ignored.**
`vibe-graph: status` surfaces them every time.
They accumulate until a human resolves them.
Never silently treat AMBIGUOUS as EXTRACTED.

**The graph is a read-optimisation, not a constraint.**
If diagnosis reveals a file that should be in the blast radius but isn't in the graph —
read the file, update the graph, continue.
The graph is a starting point.
