  Parallel task execution using Claude Code subagents. Reads task files,
  builds dependency waves, detects file conflicts AND read-write conflicts,
  and spawns tasks as parallel subagents. Size-aware wave splitting unlocks
  downstream tasks early when large tasks are in the same wave as small ones.
  If vibe-graph is installed, each subagent gets a targeted context slice
  instead of full CODEBASE.md — 60-70% cheaper per subagent on large projects.
  Structured subagent reporting with [x]/[~]/[!] states. Diagnostic retry on
  failure. Live wave progress log at vibe/parallel/. Post-wave graph update.
  Wave cost annotation for vibe-cost. Triggers on "parallel:" prefix,
  "run tasks in parallel", "spawn subagents", "parallelise the build",
  "which tasks can run in parallel", "run independent tasks simultaneously".
  Called automatically by vibe-add-feature, vibe-fix-bug, vibe-new-app
  when VIBE_MODE=autonomous or parallel tasks exist and user approves.

# Vibe Parallel Skill v2

Identifies independent tasks, builds dependency waves, and dispatches
each wave as parallel subagents via Claude Code.

**What's new in v2:**
- Read-write conflict detection (not just Touches field)
- Size-aware wave splitting (L tasks don't hold back S task dependents)
- Graph-aware context slicing per subagent (if vibe-graph installed)
- Structured subagent reporting with [x] / [~] / [!] states
- Diagnostic retry on failure (targeted, not blind)
- Live wave progress log written to vibe/parallel/
- Post-wave vibe-graph update
- Wave cost annotation for vibe-cost

---

## The principle

Independent tasks have no reason to run one after another.
If task B does not depend on task A — they run at the same time.
Subagents execute in parallel within the same Claude Code session.
The main session orchestrates: spawns waves, waits for completion,
unlocks the next wave, runs automatically until done.

---

## How it integrates with VIBE_MODE

```bash
grep "VIBE_MODE" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d ' '
```

**VIBE_MODE=autonomous:**
Parallel detection runs automatically after every planning skill.
No prompt — if independent tasks exist, subagents spawn immediately.

**VIBE_MODE=manual (default):**
Shows the parallel plan. Asks once: "Run in parallel? (y/n)"
If `n` — sequential execution, user drives with `next`.
If `y` — subagents spawn.

**On-demand (`parallel:` command):**
Always shows the plan and asks — regardless of VIBE_MODE.
The user explicitly invoked it, so confirm before launching.

---

## Entry points

### Entry point A — On demand
Triggered by: `parallel:` prefix
Read `vibe/TASKS.md` for all pending tasks.
Always show plan + ask (y/n), regardless of VIBE_MODE.

### Entry point B — Called by vibe-add-feature
Source: `vibe/features/[date-slug]/FEATURE_TASKS.md`
VIBE_MODE=autonomous → skip prompt, launch directly.
VIBE_MODE=manual → show plan, ask (y/n).

### Entry point C — Called by vibe-fix-bug
Source: `vibe/bugs/[date-slug]/BUG_TASKS.md`
Same mode logic as Entry B.

### Entry point D — Called by vibe-new-app
Source: `vibe/TASKS.md` Phase 1 tasks only.
Same mode logic as Entry B.

---

## Step 0 — Read project context

```bash
grep "VIBE_MODE" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d ' '
mkdir -p vibe/parallel
```

Read `references/WAVE_BUILDER.md` — dependency graph and conflict detection logic.
Read `references/SUBAGENT_CONTEXT.md` — context slicing and prompt construction.
Read `references/REPORTING.md` — structured completion report format.

Read `vibe/ARCHITECTURE.md` — conventions every subagent must follow.

**Check for vibe-graph:**
```bash
ls vibe/graph/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.json 2>/dev/null && echo "GRAPH_AVAILABLE" || echo "NO_GRAPH"
ls vibe/graph/.graph-meta.json 2>/dev/null && echo "META_AVAILABLE" || echo "NO_META"
```

Store result — used in Step 3 for context slicing.

---

## Step 1 — Parse tasks

Read the source task file in full.

Extract for each pending `[ ]` task:

```python
tasks = []
for each task block:
    task = {
        "id":           "[TASK-ID]",
        "title":        "[Task title]",
        "size":         "S" | "M" | "L",
        "dependencies": [],           # list of TASK-IDs or []
        "touches":      [],           # files this task WRITES
        "reads":        [],           # files this task READS (infer if not explicit)
        "description":  "[What to do]",
        "criteria":     [],           # acceptance criteria list
        "spec_ref":     "[section]",
        "codebase_update": bool,
        "arch_ref":     "[which patterns apply]"
    }
    tasks.append(task)
```

**Inferring `reads` when not explicitly listed:**
A task Reads a file when any of these are true:
- The task description says "use", "call", "import", "extend", "read" a specific file
- The task type is "test" — it reads the file it's testing
- The task is a route handler — it reads the service/agent it calls
- The task is a component — it reads the model/API it consumes

If `reads` cannot be inferred confidently — leave empty and treat conservatively.

---

## Step 2 — Build dependency waves

Read `references/WAVE_BUILDER.md` for the full algorithm.

**Summary:**

**Pass 1 — Standard dependency resolution:**
```
Wave 1: tasks where dependencies = [] (or all deps already [x])
Wave 2: tasks whose deps are all in Wave 1
Wave N: tasks whose deps are all in Wave N-1
```

**Pass 2 — File conflict check (write-write):**
If two tasks in the same wave both WRITE the same file:
→ Move the alphabetically-later task ID to the next wave.
Exception: `vibe/CODEBASE.md` and `vibe/DECISIONS.md` — append-only, safe.

**Pass 3 — Read-write conflict check:**
If Task A WRITES a file and Task B READS that same file, and both are in the same wave:
→ Task B must move to the next wave — it needs Task A's output.
This catches inheritance, base class, and schema dependencies missed by Touches alone.

**Pass 4 — Size-aware wave splitting:**
Read `references/WAVE_BUILDER.md` for the full algorithm.

Short version: if Wave N contains an L task alongside S/M tasks, and some
Wave N+1 tasks depend only on the S/M tasks (not the L task) — those
Wave N+1 tasks can be promoted to run alongside the L task in Wave N as
a "fast lane." The L task and the promoted tasks run in parallel; the
remaining Wave N+1 tasks unlock after both the L task and fast lane complete.

**Minimum threshold:**
If Wave 1 has only 1 task → no parallelism available.
Autonomous mode: proceed sequentially, no mention of parallel.
Manual mode: proceed sequentially, no prompt shown.

---

## Step 3 — Build subagent context slices

Read `references/SUBAGENT_CONTEXT.md` for the full algorithm.

**Summary:**

For each task, build a context slice — the minimum context a subagent
needs to execute that task correctly.

**If vibe-graph is available:**
```python
def build_context_slice(task, graph, meta):
    slice = {
        "task_files":    task["touches"],
        "imports":       [],     # EXTRACTED deps of task files
        "concept":       None,   # concept node from CONCEPT_GRAPH
        "rationale":     [],     # WHY/DECISION nodes for task files
        "god_nodes":     [],     # god nodes in blast radius (extra care)
        "architecture":  [],     # relevant ARCHITECTURE.md patterns
    }

    for file in task["touches"]:
        node = graph.get(file, {})
        # Add EXTRACTED imports only
        for edge in node.get("imports", []):
            if isinstance(edge, dict) and edge.get("source") == "EXTRACTED":
                slice["imports"].append(edge["file"])
            elif isinstance(edge, str):
                slice["imports"].append(edge)
        # Add rationale
        slice["rationale"].extend(node.get("rationale", []))
        # Check concept
        if not slice["concept"]:
            slice["concept"] = node.get("concept")

    # Flag god nodes in the slice
    god_node_files = {gn["file"] for gn in meta.get("god_nodes", [])}
    for f in slice["imports"] + slice["task_files"]:
        if f in god_node_files:
            gn = next(gn for gn in meta["god_nodes"] if gn["file"] == f)
            slice["god_nodes"].append(gn)

    return slice
```

Context slice replaces CODEBASE.md in the subagent prompt.
CODEBASE.md is NOT loaded by subagents when vibe-graph is available.

**If no vibe-graph:**
Fall back to providing: CODEBASE.md + ARCHITECTURE.md (standard).

**Context size estimate:**
```python
# With graph slice: ~2,000–4,000 tokens per subagent
# Without graph:    ~25,000–40,000 tokens per subagent
# Saving per subagent: ~60-70%
# On a 6-subagent wave: saves ~120,000–216,000 tokens total
```

---

## Step 4 — Present plan (manual mode only)

In autonomous mode — skip this step entirely.

```
⚡ PARALLEL EXECUTION PLAN

Wave 1 — [N] tasks run simultaneously:
  · [TASK-ID] (S) — [description]
  · [TASK-ID] (M) — [description]
  · [TASK-ID] (L) — [description]  ← long task

  Fast lane (runs with Wave 1 L task, unblocked early):
  · [TASK-ID] (S) — [description]  ← depends only on Wave 1 S/M tasks

Wave 2 — [N] tasks unlock when Wave 1 completes:
  · [TASK-ID] (M) — [description]

[Wave N...]

Conflict resolution:
  [TASK-ID] moved to Wave 2 — write conflict on src/models/brand_dna.py
  [TASK-ID] moved to Wave 2 — read-write conflict (reads base_agent.py written by [TASK-ID])

Context mode: [graph-aware slicing (vibe-graph) | full CODEBASE.md]
Est. time:    sequential ~[N]h → parallel ~[N]h (saving ~[N]h)
Est. cost:    [graph: ~$X per wave | no graph: ~$Y per wave]

Run in parallel? (y/n)
```

Wait for response. If `n` → exit, return to sequential flow.

---

## Step 5 — Initialise wave progress log

Before dispatching any subagent, write the initial status file:

```bash
mkdir -p vibe/parallel
cat > vibe/parallel/wave-[N]-status.md << 'EOF'
# Wave [N] — [feature/bug/phase name]
Started: [ISO timestamp]

## Tasks
| ID | Size | Status | Started | Completed | Duration |
|----|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| [TASK-ID] | S | 🔄 running | [time] | — | — |
| [TASK-ID] | M | 🔄 running | [time] | — | — |
| [TASK-ID] | L | 🔄 running | [time] | — | — |

## Summary
Total tasks: [N]
Complete: 0
Failed: 0
Partial: 0

## Next wave
Wave [N+1] — waiting (unlocks when all Wave [N] tasks complete)
EOF
```

Update this file as each subagent reports completion.

---

## Step 6 — Execute wave as parallel subagents

Read `references/SUBAGENT_CONTEXT.md` for the full subagent prompt format.

**Build the subagent prompt for each task:**

```
You are executing [TASK-ID] as part of a parallel build.

═══ PROJECT CONTEXT ═══
[IF graph available:]
  Architecture patterns: [relevant sections from ARCHITECTURE.md]
  Your concept: [concept name] — [concept description from CONCEPT_GRAPH]

  Your files:
  [for each file in task touches:]
    [file_path] ([type])
    Imports: [EXTRACTED imports]
    [if rationale exists:]
    Rationale:
      [WHY/DECISION/HACK entries]

  [if god nodes in slice:]
  ⚠️ GOD NODE WARNING:
    [file] — [N] connections. Changes here affect [N] other files.
    Be especially careful with any modifications to this file.

[IF no graph:]
  Read vibe/CODEBASE.md and vibe/ARCHITECTURE.md for project context.

═══ YOUR TASK ═══
[Full task block verbatim from FEATURE_TASKS.md / BUG_TASKS.md / TASKS.md]

═══ SCOPE BOUNDARIES ═══
Files you MAY write:
  [Touches field contents]

Files you must NOT write (assigned to other parallel tasks):
  [all Touches fields from other Wave N tasks]

Files you MAY read (your imports):
  [slice imports list]

═══ COMPLETION REPORT ═══
When your task is complete, output this report EXACTLY:

TASK_COMPLETE: [TASK-ID]
STATUS: [DONE|PARTIAL|FAILED]
FILES_MODIFIED: [comma-separated list]
FILES_CREATED: [comma-separated list]
TESTS_PASSED: [N]/[total]
CRITERIA:
  [x] [criterion 1]
  [x] [criterion 2]
  [ ] [criterion 3 — NOT MET: reason]
CODEBASE_UPDATE: [YES: what changed | NO]
BLOCKERS: [none | description of anything downstream tasks should know]
RATIONALE_ADDED: [YES: what WHY/DECISION comments were added | NO]
```

**Dispatch all tasks in the wave simultaneously as subagents.**

**Parse completion reports:**

Read `references/REPORTING.md` for the full parsing logic.

For each subagent completion report:

```python
def parse_completion(report):
    status = extract("STATUS", report)
    criteria = parse_criteria(report)
    unmet = [c for c in criteria if not c["met"]]

    if status == "DONE" and not unmet:
        return "COMPLETE"    # mark [x]
    elif status == "PARTIAL" or unmet:
        return "PARTIAL"     # mark [~]
    elif status == "FAILED":
        return "FAILED"      # mark [!], trigger diagnostic retry
```

**Task states:**
- `[x]` — fully complete, all criteria met, tests passed
- `[~]` — partially complete, some criteria unmet — downstream tasks are WARNED
- `[!]` — failed — trigger diagnostic retry

---

## Step 7 — Handle failures and partial completions

### Partial completion [~]

A task is partial when:
- All code is written but one or more acceptance criteria not met
- Tests pass but not all criteria are verifiable automatically
- Task completed but CODEBASE.md update was skipped

**Action:**
Log the unmet criteria in the wave progress file.
Warn downstream tasks in their subagent prompts:
```
⚠️ UPSTREAM WARNING from [TASK-ID]:
   [criterion] was not fully met: [reason]
   Your task may need to account for this — verify before marking done.
```
Do NOT block downstream tasks. Propagate the warning.

### Hard failure [!]

A task fails when: STATUS=FAILED, or tests fail, or the subagent errors out.

**Diagnostic retry (not blind retry):**

Read `references/REPORTING.md` for the diagnostic extraction logic.

```python
def build_diagnostic_retry(task, failure_report):
    # Extract the specific error
    error = extract_error(failure_report)
    # Infer most likely cause
    cause = diagnose(error, task)
    # Build targeted retry
    return f"""
RETRY — [TASK-ID]

Your previous attempt failed:
  Error: {error}
  Most likely cause: {cause}

Targeted approach for this retry:
  {targeted_fix(cause, task)}

[Original task prompt]
[Same scope boundaries]
[Same completion report format]
"""
```

On retry → if COMPLETE: mark `[x]`, continue.
On retry → if still FAILED: mark `[!]`, stop wave, surface to human.

**Stop condition:**
Any task that fails twice stops the entire wave.
Do not proceed to the next wave.
Report clearly:

```
🔴 WAVE [N] PAUSED

[TASK-ID] failed after retry.
Error: [specific error from second attempt]

Completed tasks this wave: [list — marked [x] in task file]
Partial tasks: [list — marked [~]]
Failed task: [TASK-ID]

Fix the failure, then say "resume" to continue with Wave [N+1].
The completed tasks do not need to be re-run.
```

---

## Step 8 — Update task file and progress log

After all subagents in the wave complete (or fail):

**Update FEATURE_TASKS.md / BUG_TASKS.md / TASKS.md:**
```
[x] TASK-001 · [description]   ← complete
[~] TASK-002 · [description]   ← partial — [unmet criterion]
[!] TASK-003 · [description]   ← failed — [error summary]
```

**Update CODEBASE.md (batched — main session only):**
Collect all `FILES_MODIFIED` and `FILES_CREATED` from completion reports.
The main session updates `vibe/CODEBASE.md` once — not during parallel execution.
Each subagent reports what it changed; the main session writes the update.

**Update wave progress log:**
```markdown
# Wave [N] — complete
Started: [time] · Completed: [time] · Duration: [Xm Ys]

## Tasks
| ID | Size | Status | Started | Completed | Duration |
|----|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| TASK-001 | S | ✅ complete | 14:23:00 | 14:23:42 | 42s |
| TASK-002 | M | 🟡 partial  | 14:23:00 | 14:24:15 | 75s |
| TASK-003 | L | ❌ failed   | 14:23:00 | 14:26:00 | 3m |

## Summary
Total tasks: 3 · Complete: 1 · Partial: 1 · Failed: 1

## Unmet criteria
TASK-002: [criterion] — [reason]

## Files modified this wave
[complete list from all completion reports]

## Cost
Subagent tokens: ~[N] (estimated)
Context mode: graph-aware slicing
Approx cost: ~$[X]
vs sequential: ~$[Y] (parallel [cheaper/more expensive] by $[delta])
Time saved vs sequential: ~[N] minutes
```

**Update vibe/TASKS.md "What just happened":**
```
✅ Wave [N] complete — [N] tasks done · [N] partial · [N] failed
   [task IDs]
   Cost: ~$[X] · Time saved: ~[N]min
```

---

## Step 9 — vibe-graph update (post-wave)

After each wave completes, run one graph update:

```
vibe-graph: update
```

The git diff captures all subagent writes in a single pass.
More reliable than each subagent updating the graph independently —
subagents can't safely write the same JSON file concurrently.

If vibe-graph not installed — skip this step silently.

---

## Step 10 — Execute remaining waves

For each subsequent wave:

**Check if wave is unlocked:**
All tasks in this wave have their dependencies marked `[x]`.
Tasks depending on a `[~]` partial task — include the upstream warning in their prompt.
If any dependency is `[!]` — that wave cannot proceed. Stop.

**Apply size-aware splitting to subsequent waves too.**

**Repeat Steps 5–9 for each wave.**

Wave with 1 task → run as single subagent (no parallelism, but still automatic).
Wave with 2+ tasks → parallel subagents.

---

## Step 11 — All waves complete

**Emit cost summary:**

```
⚡ Parallel execution complete

Waves:
  Wave 1: [N] tasks ✅ · [N]m [N]s · ~$[X]
  Wave 2: [N] tasks ✅ · [N]m [N]s · ~$[X]

Totals:
  Tasks complete: [N]/[N]
  Tasks partial:  [N] (see vibe/parallel/ for unmet criteria)
  Time taken:     [Xm]
  Est. sequential: ~[N]h
  Time saved:     ~[N]h ([N]% faster)
  Total cost:     ~$[X]
  Context mode:   [graph-aware | full CODEBASE.md]

Progress log: vibe/parallel/
```

**In autonomous mode:**
Signal completion to the calling skill.
Do not stop — let vibe-add-feature / vibe-fix-bug / vibe-new-app
invoke the review gate automatically.

**In manual mode:**
```
Run review: to gate this phase.
```

---

## Absolute rules

**Never give two subagents the same file to write.**
Write-write conflicts caught in Step 2 Pass 2 before any subagent launches.

**Read-write conflicts are real conflicts.**
Task B reading a file Task A writes — Task B must wait.
Caught in Step 2 Pass 3. Never skipped.

**Each subagent is completely isolated.**
No subagent reads another subagent's in-progress work.
They read the codebase as it existed before Wave 1 started.
Results merged by main session after wave completes.

**[~] partial tasks never block — they warn.**
A partial task passes its unmet criteria as warnings to downstream tasks.
Downstream tasks decide how to handle. They are not blocked.

**[!] failed tasks always stop the wave.**
On second failure — stop, report clearly, wait for human.
Never mark a task [x] if tests did not pass.

**CODEBASE.md updates are batched by the main session.**
Each subagent reports changes. Main session writes CODEBASE.md once.
This prevents concurrent JSON write conflicts.

**Graph updates happen once per wave — not per subagent.**
`vibe-graph: update` runs after wave completion.
Git diff captures all subagent writes accurately.

**Autonomous mode never skips the review gate.**
When all waves complete, signal for review.
It runs automatically, but it always runs.

**Cost annotation is always included.**
Every wave completion includes token estimate and cost.
Even if vibe-cost is not installed — the annotation is written
to the progress log so vibe-cost can read it later.
