# Vibe Agent — Standalone Agentic Architecture Skill

Designs complete multi-agent AI systems from first principles.
No other skills required. No BRIEF.md needed. Works anywhere.

Produces AGENT_ARCH.md — a complete implementation blueprint —
and two topology diagrams: interactive (inline) and static (exportable).

**Always run in Plan Mode. No code written during this session.**

## What makes a great agentic architecture

Before asking any questions, understand this:

Most agentic systems fail not because of bad code — but because of bad design.
Agents with unclear responsibilities. State shared without ownership.
Verification bolted on as an afterthought. Humans inserted too late to matter.

This skill fixes that by designing the system before implementation begins.
Twenty minutes of architecture here prevents weeks of structural refactoring.

The five decisions that determine whether an agentic system works:

1. **Pattern** — the right structural pattern for the problem
2. **Roles** — each agent has exactly one job
3. **State** — one writer per piece of state, always
4. **Verification** — every agent's output is checked before it proceeds
5. **HITL** — humans placed where their judgment genuinely adds value

---

## Step 0 — Context gathering

Check for existing context:
```bash
ls BRIEF.md AGENT_ARCH.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If AGENT_ARCH.md already exists:**
> "An AGENT_ARCH.md already exists. Do you want to update it or redesign from scratch?"
Wait for answer.

**If BRIEF.md exists:** Read it fully. Extract problem, users, constraints, integrations.
Skip any questions already answered. Surface gaps only.

**If neither exists:** Run Steps 1–2 fully.

---

## Step 1 — Understand the system

Ask all at once. Do not ask one by one.

> **Tell me about the system you're building:**
>
> 1. What is the core task this agent system accomplishes?
>    Be specific. "Help users" is not enough.
>    "Draft, review, and send brand-aligned articles based on competitor analysis" is.
>
> 2. What triggers it?
>    (User message · scheduled job · webhook · another system · event)
>
> 3. What does success look like?
>    What is the final output or action when the system works correctly?
>
> 4. What external data, APIs, or services does it need to touch?
>
> 5. Are there steps where a human must approve before continuing?
>    If yes — which steps? What would they approve?
>
> 6. What happens if the system produces wrong output?
>    (Just annoying · costs money · irreversible · embarrassing · dangerous)

Synthesise answers. Confirm before proceeding.

---

## Step 2 — Complexity and constraints

> **Scope and constraints:**
>
> 1. How many distinct task types does this system handle?
>    (1–3 = simple · 4–10 = medium · 10+ = complex)
>
> 2. Latency requirement?
>    (Real-time <2s · Interactive <30s · Async minutes/hours ok)
>
> 3. Stack preference?
>    Python / TypeScript / No preference
>
> 4. Any existing infrastructure to work with?
>    (Existing DB · auth system · APIs already in use)
>
> 5. v1 proof-of-concept or production-grade from day one?

---

## Step 3 — Framework selection

Read `references/FRAMEWORKS.md` before this step.

Based on Steps 1–2, recommend one framework with full reasoning.

Present as:

> **Recommended framework: [Framework Name]**
>
> **Why this fits your system:**
> [3-4 sentences grounded in their specific requirements — complexity, latency, cyclic vs linear, team familiarity]
>
> **What this gives you:**
> [Concrete capabilities — state management, tool calling, human-in-the-loop support, streaming]
>
> **Trade-offs:**
> [What this framework gives up vs alternatives — be honest]
>
> **Runner-up: [Framework]** — would work, but loses because [specific reason for this system]

**Framework selection rules:**
- Cyclic workflows, complex state, self-correction loops → **LangGraph**
- Linear chains, simple tool use, fast to prototype → **LangChain**
- Role-based teams, natural language task delegation → **CrewAI**
- Conversational back-and-forth between agents → **AutoGen**
- TypeScript stack, Next.js, Vercel deployment → **Vercel AI SDK**
- Maximum control, no framework overhead, custom needs → **Custom implementation**

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 4 — Pattern selection

Read `references/PATTERNS.md` before this step.

Select one primary pattern. Present recommendation with reasoning:

> **Recommended pattern: [Pattern Name]**
>
> **Why:** [2–3 sentences grounded in their specific problem]
>
> **How this maps to their system:** [Concrete description — what plays what role]
>
> **Trade-offs accepted:** [What this pattern gives up]
>
> **Alternative considered:** [Runner-up and why it loses here]

**Pattern selection rules:**
- Linear, deterministic steps, no branching → **Sequential Pipeline**
- One complex task, needs tools, variable path → **Single Agent + Tools**
- Multiple independent task types in parallel → **Parallel Specialists**
- Complex coordination, planning, delegation → **Orchestrator + Sub-agents**
- Any irreversible actions or external comms → add **HITL layer**
- Never recommend Orchestrator + Sub-agents when Single Agent + Tools suffices.
  Complexity must be earned.

Wait for confirmation.

---

## Step 5 — Agent role definition

For each agent in the system:

> **Agent roster:**
>
> | Agent | Responsibility | Inputs | Outputs | Autonomy |
> |-------|---------------|--------|---------|---------|
> | [Name] | [One sentence — what it does and nothing else] | [From: user/orchestrator/agent X] | [Produces: type + shape] | [Decides: X · Escalates: Y] |

**Role definition rules:**
- One primary responsibility per agent. "And also" = split the agent.
- Orchestrator only routes and coordinates — never does domain work.
- Name agents by what they do: `ResearchAgent` not `Agent2`.
- Human-in-the-loop modelled as an agent with infinite latency and final authority.

Present roster. Ask: "Does each agent have a single clear responsibility? Any overlap or gap?"

Wait for confirmation.

---

## Step 6 — VerifierAgent design

Every agent in the system gets a VerifierAgent. No exceptions.

For each agent, define its verifier:

> **VerifierAgent rubrics:**
>
> | Verifier | Checks agent | Contract | Spec compliance | Quality bar | Consistency |
> |----------|-------------|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|
> | [AgentNameVerifier] | [AgentName] | [exact output schema] | [acceptance criteria] | [quality threshold] | [prior outputs to align with] |

**Verdict format — always structured:**
```
VERDICT: PASS | FAIL
CHECKS:
  Contract:    pass | fail — [reason]
  Spec:        pass | fail — [reason]
  Quality:     pass | fail — [reason]
  Consistency: pass | fail — [reason]
FIX INSTRUCTIONS: [specific, actionable — only on FAIL]
```

**Retry logic baked into every pattern:**
```
Agent output → Verifier checks
  PASS → proceed
  FAIL (attempt 1) → send output + fix instructions back to Agent
  Agent retries
  PASS → proceed
  FAIL (attempt 2) → escalate to HITL
```

Shared vs dedicated verifiers: if two agents have near-identical rubrics → one shared verifier.

---

## Step 7 — Tool and MCP mapping

For each agent, map every tool it needs:

> | Agent | Tool | Type | Purpose | Risk level |
> |-------|------|------|---------|-----------|
> | [Name] | [tool] | read/write/compute/MCP/handoff | [why this agent, not another] | [low/medium/high] |

**Tool types:**
- **Read** — web search, document retrieval, DB query, API GET
- **Write** — send email, create ticket, write file, API POST/PUT
- **Compute** — code execution, data transformation, calculations
- **MCP** — Jira, Slack, Google Drive, Salesforce, Notion, etc.
- **Handoff** — passing control to another agent

**Flag immediately:**
- Any write tool assigned to more than one agent → coordination risk
- Any write tool that produces irreversible output → HITL required before use
- Any tool requiring credentials → note in implementation section

---

## Step 8 — State and memory design

> **State architecture:**
>
> **Session state** (lives for one pipeline run):
> - What: [list of state keys]
> - Owner: [which agent writes each key]
> - Format: [dict / typed schema / message list]
>
> **Cross-run memory** (persists between invocations):
> - Storage: [none / SQLite / Postgres / vector DB / Redis]
> - Schema: [key fields]
> - Use case: [what it remembers and why]
>
> **State ownership table:**
> | Key | Owner (writes) | Readers | Format |
> |-----|---------------|---------|--------|
> | [key] | [agent] | [agents] | [type] |

**State design rules:**
- One agent owns each state key. Others read. Only the owner writes.
- Prefer message-passing over shared mutable stores.
- HITL checkpoints are state transitions — system pauses at known state, human acts, resumes.
- If cross-run memory uses a DB: define the schema now. Retrofitting mid-build is expensive.

Flag any multi-writer state as a race condition risk.

---

## Step 9 — Human-in-the-loop design

**Non-negotiable HITL triggers:**
- Agent sends external communications (email, Slack, SMS, social)
- Agent executes financial transactions
- Agent deletes or permanently modifies data
- Agent operates in regulated domain (legal, medical, financial)
- Agent output will be seen by external parties before human review

For each checkpoint:

> | # | Location | What human sees | Actions available | Timeout behaviour |
> |---|---------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
> | 1 | After [step] | [context shown — enough to decide] | Approve / Reject / Edit / Redirect | [escalate / cancel / flag and continue] |

**HITL interface requirements:**
- Human must see enough context to make a good decision — not just "approve Y/N?"
- Actions must be unambiguous
- Timeout must be handled — never leave the system blocked indefinitely
- State at checkpoint must be durable — if human takes 2 hours, state is not lost

---

## Step 10 — Implementation plan

Read `references/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` before this step.

Produce a concrete implementation plan:

### Framework setup

For the recommended framework, provide exact setup:

**LangGraph:**
```python
# Core dependencies
pip install langgraph langchain-anthropic

# State definition
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
import operator

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    # [state keys from Step 8]
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    [key]: [type]

# Graph construction pattern
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
graph.add_node("[agent_name]", [agent_function])
graph.add_edge("[agent_a]", "[agent_b]")
graph.set_entry_point("[first_agent]")
```

**CrewAI:**
```python
pip install crewai crewai-tools

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

[agent_name] = Agent(
    role="[role]",
    goal="[goal]",
    backstory="[context]",
    tools=[],
    verbose=True
)
```

**Vercel AI SDK:**
```typescript
npm install ai @ai-sdk/anthropic

import { generateText, tool } from 'ai'
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic'
```

### Implementation order

Tasks in this exact sequence:

```
Phase 1 — Foundation
  [ ] Set up project structure (see boilerplate below)
  [ ] Install framework dependencies
  [ ] Define state schema
  [ ] Implement base agent class / shared utilities
  [ ] Create mock tool responses for testing

Phase 2 — Agents (in dependency order)
  [For each agent in dependency order:]
  [ ] Implement [AgentName] — [one line description]
  [ ] Write [AgentName]Verifier
  [ ] Unit test: agent produces correct output shape
  [ ] Integration test: verifier correctly passes/fails

Phase 3 — Orchestration
  [ ] Implement orchestrator / graph routing
  [ ] Wire agent-to-agent handoffs
  [ ] Implement HITL checkpoints
  [ ] Implement retry logic (retry once → escalate)
  [ ] End-to-end test: full pipeline with mock data

Phase 4 — Production hardening
  [ ] Replace mock tools with real implementations
  [ ] Add timeout handling on all agent calls
  [ ] Add exponential backoff on LLM failures
  [ ] Add state persistence (if cross-run memory needed)
  [ ] Load test: concurrent pipeline runs
```

## Step 11 — Synthesise and confirm

> **Agentic architecture summary — [System Name]:**
>
> **Framework:** [chosen] — [one sentence why]
> **Pattern:** [chosen]
> **Agents:** [N] — [name list]
> **Verifiers:** [N] — [shared/dedicated breakdown]
> **Tools:** [N] across [N] agents ([write tools flagged])
> **State:** [session / cross-run / both]
> **HITL checkpoints:** [N] — [where in the flow]
> **Implementation phases:** 4 · Est. [N] days
>
> Does this look right? Anything to adjust before I write AGENT_ARCH.md and generate the diagrams?

Wait for confirmation.

---

## Step 12 — Write AGENT_ARCH.md

Read `references/AGENT_ARCH_TEMPLATE.md` for the full format.

Fill every section from confirmed decisions in Steps 1–10.
Save as `AGENT_ARCH.md` at project root.

Every section must be grounded in decisions made — no placeholders.

---

## Step 13 — Generate topology diagrams

Generate **both** diagrams immediately after writing AGENT_ARCH.md.

### Diagram 1 — Interactive inline diagram

Use the `show_widget` visualizer tool.

The diagram must show:
- **Trigger** — entry point (coral pill, top)
- **Orchestrator** — if present (purple, large, below trigger)
- **Agents** — specialist nodes (teal, medium)
- **Verifiers** — between each agent and its output (green, smaller)
- **Retry arrows** — dashed from verifier back to agent (labelled "retry + fix")
- **Escalation arrows** — solid from verifier to HITL on second fail
- **HITL checkpoints** — amber, dashed border, full width
- **Tools** — small gray pills connected to their agent by dashed lines
- **State store** — green rounded rect on the side if cross-run memory exists
- **Output** — coral pill at bottom

Every node is clickable — `sendPrompt('Tell me more about [NodeName]')`.

**Visual hierarchy:**
- Flow direction: top to bottom
- Orchestrator centred
- Sub-agents spread horizontally
- Verifiers inline between agent and next step
- Tools as satellites — never in the main flow

### Diagram 2 — Static exportable SVG

After the interactive diagram, generate a clean static SVG version.

Same topology, same colour coding.
No JavaScript. No event handlers. No interactive elements.
Clean enough to paste into a Notion page, Figma, or a slide deck.

Save to `agent-architecture.svg` at project root.
Present it using the present_files tool.

---

## Step 13 — Hand off to spec-review

Before telling the user anything, announce:
> "AGENT_ARCH.md written. Running spec-review to validate agent design..."

Invoke `vibe-spec-review` with:
- Trigger source: `agent`
- Scope: AGENT_ARCH.md + BRIEF.md (if exists)

After spec-review completes:

## Step 14 — Tell the user

```
✅ Agentic architecture complete — [System Name]

AGENT_ARCH.md written — [N] sections
Framework:    [framework] — [one line why]
Pattern:      [pattern]
Agents:       [N] ([names])
Verifiers:    [N] ([shared/dedicated])
Tools:        [N] ([write tools: N])
HITL gates:   [N]
Impl phases:  4 phases · est. [N] days

DIAGRAMS
  Interactive: rendered above (clickable)
  Static SVG:  agent-architecture.svg (download below)

NEXT STEPS
  1. Review AGENT_ARCH.md — confirm all decisions look right
  2. Start with Phase 1: project structure + dependencies
  3. Build agents in the implementation order above
  4. Wire the orchestrator last — after all agents are tested individually

The AGENT_ARCH.md is self-contained. Share it with your team.
It has everything needed to implement this system from scratch.
```

## Conversation principles

**Framework recommendation is opinionated.** Don't list all six and ask the user to choose.
Recommend one. Explain why it fits their specific system. Let them override.

**Pattern recommendation is opinionated.** Same principle.
Complexity must be earned — don't recommend Orchestrator + Sub-agents when
Single Agent + Tools would do the job.

**Roles must be singular.** Push back on "and also."
An agent that does two things is two agents that haven't been separated yet.

**Verification is non-negotiable.** Every agent gets a verifier.
"We'll add verification later" means it never happens.

**HITL placement is a design decision, not a checkbox.**
"Add a human checkpoint" is meaningless. "Human sees the competitor list
and confirms before content strategy begins" is a design decision.

**Be honest about trade-offs.** Every framework choice and pattern choice
gives something up. Surface what's lost, not just what's gained.

**The diagram is part of the deliverable.** Not an afterthought.
A well-designed agentic system should be explainable in one diagram.
If the diagram is too complex to read, the system is too complex to build.
